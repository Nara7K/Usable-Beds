A Garry's Mod addon that aims to add player-usable beds in the simplest way possible. (Open-source, too!)

These are essentially typical prisoner pod vehicle entities that are positioned upright and plays one of the playermodel select screen "show-off" animations.

Issues:
- Currently I don't know how to change the view position of the player on the bed.
- I don't know how to apply the same technique on 2-person beds.
